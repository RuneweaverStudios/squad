Implement a discount code system for the shop:

- Discount code model: code, type (percentage/fixed), value, usageLimit, usedCount, expiresAt
- POST /api/cart/apply-discount - validate and apply discount code
- GET /api/admin/discounts - list all discount codes (admin only)
- Frontend discount input field in checkout
- Show applied discount in cart summary
- Admin page to create and manage discount codes
- Validate expiration dates and usage limits

Build this feature with SvelteKit and ensure proper error handling for invalid/expired codes.
