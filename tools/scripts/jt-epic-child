# jt-epic-child - Add epic→child dependency (correct direction)
#
# Usage: jt-epic-child <epic-id> <child-id>
#
# This ensures the dependency direction is always correct:
# - Epic depends on child (epic blocked until child completes)
# - NOT child depends on epic (which would block the child)
#
# Example:
#   jt-epic-child jat-039k jat-abc
#   # Result: jat-039k depends on jat-abc
