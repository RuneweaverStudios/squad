Since the projectColors module uses a plain JS object (not reactive Svelte state), the component does not re-render when colors arrive. Fix: Add a reactive state variable projectColors in the sessions page that gets populated when colors are fetched, and use that for row border colors instead of calling getProjectColor directly.","expectedFiles":["ide/src/routes/sessions/+page.svelte","ide/src/lib/utils/projectColors.ts"]},"git_sha":"394e3a3","agent_name":"PaleCliff"}
