# Getting Started with SQUAD

**Get a multi-agent IDE running in 5 minutes.**

SQUAD (Jomarchy Agent Tools) lets you coordinate multiple AI coding agents working in parallel on your codebase. The IDE is your command center.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install SQUAD

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RuneweaverStudios/squad/master/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Add Your Projects

SQUAD needs to know about your projects. By default, it scans `~/code/`:

```bash
squad init                    # Auto-discover projects in ~/code/
```

**Custom project paths?** Edit `~/.config/squad/projects.json`:
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "name": "MY-APP",
      "path": "~/projects/my-app",
      "port": 3000
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Launch the IDE

```bash
squad                         # Opens http://localhost:3333
```

You'll see:
- **Tasks page** - Your backlog across all projects
- **Work page** - Active agent sessions
- **Agents page** - Agent status and coordination

### 4. Create Your First Task

In the IDE:
1. Click **"+ New Task"**
2. Enter a title and description
3. Set priority (P0 = critical, P2 = normal)
4. Click **Create**

Or via CLI:
```bash
cd ~/code/my-project
st create "Add user authentication" --priority 1 --type feature
```

### 5. Launch an Agent

```bash
squad my-project              # Launches: VS Code + Claude + IDE
# OR
squad my-project --claude     # Claude only (faster)
# OR
squad-myproject               # Shortcut function (generated by install)
```

The agent:
1. Runs inside **tmux** (required for IDE tracking)
2. Auto-runs `/squad:start`
3. Shows available tasks
4. You pick a task, agent starts working

### 6. Watch the Magic

In the IDE **Work** page, you'll see:
- Agent status (working, needs input, ready for review)
- Current task progress
- Real-time signals from agents
- EventStack timeline of agent activity

---

## Launch a Swarm (Multiple Agents)

```bash
squad my-project 4            # Launch 4 Claude sessions
squad my-project 4 --auto     # 4 agents that auto-pick tasks
```

Each agent:
- Gets assigned different tasks (no conflicts)
- Reserves files to prevent collisions
- Coordinates via Agent Registry (file reservations)
- Reports status to IDE

---

## Key Concepts

### One Agent = One Session = One Task

Each Claude session handles exactly one task. When complete:
1. Run `/squad:complete`
2. Session ends
3. Spawn new agent for next task

This keeps context clean and focused.

### Task Flow

```
Create task (ide/CLI)
       ↓
Agent picks task (/squad:start)
       ↓
Agent works (code, test, document)
       ↓
Agent signals review
       ↓
You approve → /squad:complete
       ↓
Task closed, agent session ends
       ↓
Next task → spawn new agent
```

### SQUAD Task Sync

Tasks live in `.squad/tasks.db` and sync via git:
- You commit → tasks sync to repo
- Teammate pulls → they see your tasks
- Shared backlog across the team

## Common Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `squad` | Launch IDE |
| `squad <project>` | Full dev environment |
| `squad <project> --claude` | Claude only |
| `squad <project> 4` | Launch 4 agents |
| `squad list` | Show all projects |
| `squad init` | Auto-discover projects |
| `st ready` | Show tasks ready to work |
| `st create "Title"` | Create a task |

---

## Tmux Requirement

**Agents MUST run in tmux for IDE tracking.**

The `squad` command handles this automatically. If you see "NOT IN TMUX SESSION" in the statusline, exit and use `squad <project>` instead of running Claude directly.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create some tasks** in the IDE
2. **Launch an agent** with `squad <project>`
3. **Watch the Work page** as agent progresses
4. **Try `/squad:complete`** when agent is done

For full documentation, see [README.md](./README.md).

## Troubleshooting

**IDE won't start?**
```bash
# Find your install location (usually ~/.local/share/squad or ~/code/squad)
cd ~/.local/share/squad/ide   # or ~/code/squad/ide for developers
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Agent shows offline?**
- Not running in tmux. Use `squad <project>` to launch properly.

**Custom project path?**
- Edit `~/.config/squad/projects.json` manually (see step 2 above)

**Tasks not syncing?**
- Commit `.squad/tasks.db` to git
- Teammate pulls to get updates
