Add a comment system to the blog with these requirements:

- Comment model with fields: author, email, content, postId, approved, createdAt
- GET /api/posts/[id]/comments - fetch approved comments for a post
- POST /api/posts/[id]/comments - submit new comment (pending approval)
- Frontend comment display component showing approved comments
- Comment submission form with validation
- IMPORTANT: Ask user whether to use inline moderation or separate admin panel for comment approval
- Style with Tailwind CSS

Please create a detailed implementation plan and use /jat:bead to convert it into executable tasks.
